- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paulupdev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in MERN stacks (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m well-versed in translating UX concepts into code, developing new user features, and participating in code reviews. I have ability to craft code for various software functions, test the functionality of web applications, and tweak the code to perfection.
